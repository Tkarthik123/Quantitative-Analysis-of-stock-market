# Quantitative-Analysis-of-stock-market
**Overview**
This project focuses on the quantitative analysis of stock market data to identify patterns, trends, and potential trading opportunities using data science and machine learning techniques. The goal is to explore and model historical stock price data, applying quantitative metrics and statistical analysis to gain insights into market behavior.

**Project Objectives**
Analyze historical stock price data to understand market trends.
Apply quantitative methods to measure stock performance and volatility.
Develop predictive models to forecast stock prices based on historical data.
Visualize data and findings for easy interpretation and insight discovery.
Data Sources
The data used in this project is sourced from Yahoo Finance and includes information such as:

Open, High, Low, Close, and Adjusted Close prices.
Trading Volume.
Methods and Techniques
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, seasonal patterns, and volatility.
Quantitative Analysis: Calculating indicators like Moving Averages, RSI, and Bollinger Bands.
Predictive Modeling: Building time series models (ARIMA, LSTM) for price forecasting.
Data Visualization: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visual representations of stock trends.
